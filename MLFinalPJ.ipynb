    "1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are millions of beautiful flowers bursting around every corner, & we've been constantly awed by the beauty & uniqueness of each flower. Classifiying different flowers from one another is indeed a challenging task, as there're a plethora of flowers to classify & flowers can appear similar to each other. However, classifiying different flowers species will be advantageous in the fields such as the pharmaceutical industry, botany, agricultural, & trade activities, which is why we thought of performing this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of this project is to solve a Supervised Image Classification problem of classifying the flower types - rose, chamomile, dandelion, sunflower, & tulip. In the end, we’ll have a trained model, which can predict the class of the flower using a Machine Learning algorithm, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this project was the Flowers Recognition dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 5 classes of flower species - rose, chamomile, dandelion, sunflower, & tulip, each having about 800 images. So, we’ve a total of 4242 images to train our model with.\n",

    "3.1 Importing Libraries\n",

    "This code should only run once for the entire project because its purpose is to extract data and convert it into an npz file for use during the program. Once the npz file has been created, it does not need to be created multiple times since we hold a reference to these files.\n",

    "Initally, the following libraries were imported to use in the data conversion process:"
